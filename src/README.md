# Root Directory 
The index.js file is a typical index file for rendering the app

registerServiceWorker.js is an auto generated file from CRA. Currently is unused.

The App directory is a react app based on the App domain. For multiple domains, there will be multiple such 
directories. See the README inside the APP directory for more details.

The internals directory is for configuring all the redux tools. See the README inside for more details.

### TODO 
Find out how to put the service worker into better use.
